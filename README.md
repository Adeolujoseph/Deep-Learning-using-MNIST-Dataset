#Pytorch
The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image  THE ORIGINAL DATA SET CAN BE FOUND IN http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
This projects uses 2 hidden Layers with 128 and 64 units. 
SGD optimizer was used to improve the Weights and bias
